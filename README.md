# Minty

An experimental VSCode extension that shows what an LLM powered linter might feel like.

The experiment was also intended as a way to get an idea of what programming via an AI chatbot feels like.
The code in this repository was written largely by chatting to Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT interface.

Initial bootstrap was through `yo code` -- the LLM provided the initial command for me to run.

I self-imposed a "no-Googling" rule during development, everything from VSCode API documentation to the majority of the code itself was provided by LLM.
